feat: Add tokenomics implementation and optimize gas usage in contracts
- Introduced the tokenomics logic for handling token distribution and rewards.
- Optimized gas usage in the smart contract by reducing redundant storage reads/writes.
- Enhanced contract security with proper access control mechanisms (e.g., modifiers).
- Added unit tests to ensure correct behavior of core functions.
- Updated documentation to reflect new changes in tokenomics implementation.
